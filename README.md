## How to install :

- Go to https://wordpress.org/themes/thematic and download thematic. We aren't using the github version anymore because it is adding styles by default somehow.
- Unzip and paste the folder inside wp-content/themes
Now fork this repository in the same folder as thematic and activate it in the backend.
- Once that is done, download and activate the woocommerce plugin and upload a background image via the avargadi theme options inside appearance/avaragadi theme options.
Now go to appearance/customize and make the front page as the shop page.

## Setting up woocommerce

- Install woocommerce
- Setup theme
- Install 'Regenerate Thumbnails' plugin
- Go to woocommerce>products>product image sizes and remove the hard crop tick boxes and remove the pixel values of the image size(so there is nothing in the text box)
- Go to tools and regenerate thumbnails
- Go to appearance>widgets and remove all widgets for the primary aside and secondary aside

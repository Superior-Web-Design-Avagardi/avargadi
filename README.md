## How to install :

- Go to https://wordpress.org/themes/thematic and download thematic. We aren't using the github version anymore because it is adding styles by default somehow.
- Unzip and paste the folder inside wp-content/themes
Now fork this repository in the same folder as thematic and activate it in the backend.
To check if you have done everything correctly, you should reminded of a webpage made in circa 1999 when you open your site.
